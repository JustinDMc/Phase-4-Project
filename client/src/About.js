                Welcome to our humble pizzeria! We are a Ma and Pa restaurant that fell in love with making pizza while visiting Southern Italy. Justin, the master mind of the restaurant insuring good vibes, and Allen, our master chef, who pours his sweat and tears into every pizza he makes insuring every man, women, and child is happy.  We pride ourselves on having fresh ingredients and a family feel while visiting our restaurant. All our pizzas are cooked in a wood-fire oven that burn at a whopping 1000ÂºF constantly, meaning your pizzas are done in a flash and hot A.F.! We also offer an open floor design for our restaurant with a patio and patio bar, rain or shine, it stays open for your enjoyment.
